# David Chu's China Bistro

The site is published at [David Chu's China Bistro](https://su-ok.github.io/coursera-test/module5-solution/).

## Description

This was the final project I did as a part of a Coursera course - [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Developers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers). This is a basic multi-page responsive website of a fictitious restaurant, which can be used as a template for building restaurant portfolio websites.

It showcases the basic features of a restaurant such as main seating area, Google location, menu categories, working hours, and reviews. Additionally, there's a Specials category which is randomly updated every time the Specials category page loads - so that you can get a flavor of all ;-) (All thanks to JavaScript!).

This website also implements responsiveness for a comfortable user experience on all kinds of devices.

This project was my first real delve into Web Development.

## Limitations

- The About and Awards options have not been implemented yet.
- The home page currently has one static image of a restaurant, which I intend to turn into an image slideshow as the Gallery of the restaurant later.
- The overall functionality of this website is basic and can be made more efficient to create a real-world product.

## Key Learnings

- Learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript all from scratch
- Learning about media queries and implementing responsiveness
- Working with tools such as Visual Studio Code
- A glimpse into the World Of Web
- Making code readable and documenting it

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Prof. [Yaakov Chaikin](https://clearlydecoded.com/) for his highly extensive and methodical lectures on the basics of Web Development. I never could have imagined implementing a full-fledged website all from scratch.
